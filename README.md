# OptiArk New
The new repo for building OptiArk packs, all old versions that are not 1.21.11 are now depricated and will NOT be updated unless some surious issue pops up with the packs.

# Extra Notes:
If you feel like a version should be supported for this pack, then use the update.sh command to make your own version of the pack, its super simple and usualy works very well, its reccomended the lowest you go is 1.21.4 for the version. The script also tells you what incompatible mods there are too.
#### Note: For ModpackUtils and MainMenuCredits, re enable those mods if their disabled as those are supported from 1.21-1.21.11 even though it says their not.

# Update.sh Usage
#### Discription: Lets you upgrade or downgrade modpacks and update/downgrade all of the mods with it.
#### Usage: ``./upgrade-pack.sh <pack-folder> <new-mc-version>``
#### Example: ``./upgrade-pack.sh sodium 1.21.10``

# disable-mod.sh Usage
#### Discription: Lets you disable mods in any of the 3 packs
#### Usage: ``./disable-mod.sh sodium nvidium``
